# Deepfake Audio Detection

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on detecting **audio deepfakes** — synthetic voices generated by advanced AI models that threaten security, trust, and authentication systems. We compare **classical machine learning** and **deep learning** approaches for reliable detection in real-world conditions.

## 🚀 Methods
We employ three complementary detection strategies:


1. **CQCC + GMM**  
   - Extract Constant-Q Cepstral Coefficients (CQCCs).  
   - Classify using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) with log-likelihood ratios.  
   - ✅ Robust, inherits strengths from traditional anti-spoofing.

2. **CNN + Mel-Spectrograms**  
   - Convert audio into Mel-spectrograms.  
   - Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for end-to-end learning.  
   - ✅ State-of-the-art accuracy.

## 📊 Results
- **CNN**: Achieves highest accuracy on the *In-the-Wild* dataset.  
- **CQCC-GMM**: Provides robustness against varied spoofing conditions.  

👉 Together, these approaches illustrate the **trade-off between classical ML and deep learning** in audio deepfake detection.
